# Designing a Simple Webpage with HTML and CSS

## Required applications
1. A Text Editing Program (Any of the following will work as well as many others).
    - VSCode
    - Notepad
    - Ms Word (Keep in mind that word cannot write CSS files as easily as the others on the list)

## Important Notes
**For this tutorial I will be using VSCode as my text editor and I will be including snippets of code as displayed in VSCode. I will also attempt to explain terms that were not covered in the What is HTML and CSS documents when they should arise.**

### In order to start we must open our text editing software and for our means we will create a new folder.
#### We will start by establishing a folder for our webpage

2. Navigate to where you would like to store your Webpage Tutorial.
3. Right click on an open space and move your mouse to the New drop down.

5. Create two Div elements with-in the Nav element and one div element with-in the Section element.
    - Give the first Div element in Nav a class by typing &lt;div class="logo"&gt;Logo Name &lt;/div&gt;
6. Create a Div element in the section element we made in step 4 giv it the class content-container.
    - With-in this Div create two more Div elements and give one the class column-left.

7. Create your content for your Navigation bar using Href tags and place them in your Nav's second div element.
    - I will be using three navigation buttons labeled Home, About, and Contact us.
8. Create your content in your Section element within the div that we have given the class Column-left.
    - I will put some text as well as a button that refers to my imaginary teahouse business.
